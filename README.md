# Logistics AI Optimizer - Operations & Supply Chain Management

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_svg)](https://logistic-ai-valentisecanell.streamlit.app/)

This platform is an **Industrial Engineering** solution designed to optimize fleet management and mitigate logistical delays through advanced data analytics and operational research.

## Project Overview
As an **Industrial Engineer**, the goal of this project is to transform raw operational data (GPS, traffic patterns, asset utilization, and environmental variables) into **actionable strategic decisions**. 

This tool identifies root causes of inefficiencies in the supply chain, allowing operations managers to maximize asset performance while minimizing mechanical risks and delivery lead times.



## Key Features
- **Operational KPIs:** Real-time monitoring of Delay Rates, Asset Utilization Efficiency, and Cargo Conditions.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Interactive breakdown of delays (Traffic, Weather, Mechanical Failure) for targeted interventions.
- **Predictive Asset Maintenance:** Identification of over-utilized assets to prevent breakdowns and optimize maintenance schedules.
- **Automated Data Pipeline:** Instant processing of CSV/Excel datasets for rapid diagnostic reporting.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Data Engineering:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Streamlit
- **Data Visualization:** Plotly Express (Dynamic charting)

## Repository Structure
- `app.py`: Core application logic and Streamlit interface.
- `smart_logistics_dataset.csv`: Sample dataset for demonstration purposes.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for cloud deployment.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
